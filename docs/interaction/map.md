# Map

## Desired Properties

- minimap shares space with object inspection when nothing is selected
- full screen map available
- respects fog of war
- clearly get a sense of place and scale
- scout for new resources

## Constraints

- limited color differentiation

## Key Uncertainties

- is there a way for us to detect historical problem areas at a whole-base level using the map?
- can we feasibly compute the various overlay filters at the map level?
