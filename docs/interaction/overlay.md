# Informational Overlay

## Desired Properties

- examine a piece of information by displaying its level in every tile
- information types
  - signals
    - quantity
    - divergence
    - curl?
  - organism statistics
    - mass
    - intent
    - growth rate
    - resource consumption rate?
  - environment
    - soil type
    - soil water
    - soil nutrients
- use color to show this in a spatial fashion
- information should correspond to that available in [Production Statistics](production-statistics.md)

## Constraints

## Uncertainties

- can we meaningfully display more than one dimension at once?
- can we scale this up to a full map with reasonable performance?
  - is pausing acceptable for this?
