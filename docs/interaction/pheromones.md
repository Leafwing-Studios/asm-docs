# Pheromones

Pheromones are the player's primary tool for interacting quickly with the world.

Select a pheromone using the ping wheel, then click over a tile to use it, depleting your regenerating supply of pheromones.

## Agency

Pheromones use a resource called **agency**, which is slowly and automatically produced over time.
The purpose of agency is to gate and manage the amount of micromanaging that the player must perform.

You can increase your agency production and cap and unlock new pheromone options by completing [milestones](milestones.md).

You can spend agency to:

- use pheromones
- change [signal sensitivity / production](sensitivity.md) of a strain
- slowly produce organisms from a species of your choice at a [research site](genetics.md)

## Types of pheromones

### COME

Creates a powerful universal signal for your own units. Once they reach the peak of the signal, they ignore the signal for a while.

### AMPLIFY

Amplifies the existing signals that are being produced by the tile in question.

# PRODUCE

Increases the production rate of a structure, or the productivity of a worker. Diffuses over time.

# FIGHT

Increases the recklessness and buffs the combat effectiveness of your organisms. Diffuses over time.

# DIFFERENTIATE

Controls the type of unit produced by eggs.

# Tolerances

- pheromones can be less physically grounded and realistic than other mechanics. Players accept their strangeness as a way to make the game feel better

# Constraints

- these need to be unlocked immediately to reduce frustration
- pheromones need to feel powerful enough to solve sudden problems
- using these regularly should not feel mandatory
- the quantity of pheromones should not death spiral as the factory fails
- pheromones should not be magic: they must rely on existing organisms to do their work
- all pheromones target a single tile for UI consistency

# Key Uncertainties

- what pheromones do we want to exist?
- how can you customize your pheromone production?
- thematically, why can you use these anywhere instantly?
- time windows
  - time to full capacity
  - time to exhausted when spamming from full capacity
- should you be forced to spend pheromones to adjust signal sensitivity? Similar sort of action
