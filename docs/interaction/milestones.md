# Milestones

Milestones are tied to specific in-game actions, and serve as the primary form of tutorialization.

These are arranged into tiers, corresponding to the intended [progression](../strategy/progression.md) through the game.

When you complete a milestone, your [pheromone](pheromones.md) capacity increases. When you complete an entire tier, a new type of pheromone (or other tangible bonus) is unlocked.

## Constraints

- must be prominent in game to remind players of goals
- must feel like reasonable goals, not gimmicks
- must lead to tangible benefits
  - these should be persistent
  - these cannot be too abstract (e.g. tech tree progression) because then they feel unfair
  - these cannot be too concrete (e.g. a pile of goods) because then they feel arbitrary and unrealistic
- cannot be linearly gated, as this leads to really stale gameplay
- must reset between games to remind players of goals and create progress
