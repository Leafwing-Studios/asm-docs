# Object Inspection

## Desired properties

- examine what a particular organism or environment object selected is doing
  - quickly scale up to many copies of the same strain in a region, for examining sub-factories
- debug intents and needs
- examine some historical properties to evaluate performance: unfulfilled needs, amount of time spent doing various actions etc.
- quick overview, then splits into detailed overview
  - selected units
  - the strain's properties (genetic research menu)
