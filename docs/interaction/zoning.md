# Zoning

## Desired Properties

- emits pull signals for contents
  - structures, for building stuff
  - objects, for storing stuff
- emits push signals for when the contents are wrong
- mushrooms can be reinforced directly
- plants just need seeds
- can zone for [research sites](genetics.md)
  - calls for ants to work
- strong blueprinting capabilities
  - cut, copy, paste
  - upgrade and deconstruction planners
  - blueprint library
    - always game specific

## Constraints

- must be able to zone specific structures
- must be able to zone tiles as clear to allow for walking paths
- ergonomics must be good: cut, copy, paste, clear are critical

## Uncertainties

- should structures automatically work like buffer chests?
- do we ant buffer zoning? useful for slowly passing goods down a line
