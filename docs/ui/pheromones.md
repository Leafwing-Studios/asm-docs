Pheromones are the player's primary tool for interacting quickly with the world.

Select a pheromone, then click over a tile to use it, depleting your regenerating supply of pheromones.

# Types of pheromones

# COME

Creates a powerful universal signal for your own units. Once they reach the peak of the signal, they switch to other tasks?

# AMPLIFY

Amplifies the existing signals that are being produced by the tile in question.

# PRODUCE

Increases the production rate of a structure, or the productivity of a worker. Diffuses over time.

# FIGHT

Increases the recklessness and buffs the combat effectiveness of your organisms. Diffuses over time.

# Tolerances

- pheromones can be less physically grounded and realistic than other mechanics. Players accept their strangeness as a way to make the game feel better

# Constraints

- these need to be unlocked immediately to reduce frustration
- pheromones need to feel powerful enough to solve sudden problems
- using these regularly should not feel mandatory
- the quantity of pheromones should not death spiral as the factory fails
- pheromones should not be magic: they must rely on existing organisms to do their work
- all pheromones target a single tile for UI consistency

# Key Uncertainties

- what pheromones do we want to exist?
- what resources are used to make pheromones, if any?
- how can you customize your pheromone production?
- does pheromone production need to scale as you play the game?
- thematically, why can you use these anywhere instantly?
- time windows
  - time to full capacity
  - time to exhausted when spamming from full capacity
- in the late game, should you be able to automate pheromone usage?
- should you be forced to spend pheromones to adjust signal sensitivity? Similar sort of puzzle
