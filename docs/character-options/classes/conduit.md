# Conduit

**Source of Power:** Conduits collect and focus the ambient magic of their surroundings, carefully channeling this magic into items before releasing it in a surge of power.

**Core Mechanic:** The spells that conduits cast can be directed into their weapons instead, imbuing their basic attacks with incredible magic that chains between their foes.

**Specialization:** Conduits learn to master specific enchantments, permanently gaining the effect of specific affixes as they level up.

**Approach to Adventure:** The Conduit’s skill in temporarily imbuing items with magic transfers naturally to doing so permanently, lending them a distinct advantage during various downtime activities related to enchanting.

**Build Fundamentals:** Whether they are shooting arrows of light at the enemy or wielding a flaming sword, Conduits make excellent strikers, with the option to focus more heavily on control if they so choose:

- Striker: Opt into the risky double-edged spells like roar of fire to maximize your output, then select armor affixes like _immunity_ to mitigate their downsides.
- Controller: Double down on your ailments, selecting affixes like _imbued strikes_ and _merciless_ to apply more of them and then amplify their effects with exotic affixes like _absolute zero_.

## Conduit Casting

Conduits fight by channeling their **spells** into their weaponry, releasing them in an explosive show of force when they strike their foes.

At level 1, whenever you cast a spell, you may choose to channel it into your weapon instead. The spell stays **charged** in your weapon until you hit a creature with a basic attack using that weapon or complete a rest. When you attempt a basic attack with that weapon, the spell discharges, affecting the creature if you strike and fizzling harmlessly if you miss. No additional special attack is required for the spell, even if it would normally have one.

Each set of arms may only hold one charged spell at a time. Casting any further spells into it causes the previous spell to fizzle away harmlessly. Your holstered weapons can continue to hold stored spells.

You learn 4 spells at level 1, each of which takes a minor action and costs 1 essence. You learn an additional spell at level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19. Select these from the Spells section at the end of this class description.

These spells can also be cast on their own, directly at the target, with a 4 tile range, and using the attack roll specified in the spell description.

## Mastery: Weaponry

The Conduit’s talents with the infusion of magic transfer naturally to the creation and modification of magical equipment. At level 1, you also gain the ability to permanently imbue any set of weaponry you wield with a form of enchantment that you have mastered.

When you gain this feature, select a non-prismatic arms affix with a gear point cost of 1. Arms that you wield automatically gain the benefit of this affix.

## Persistence

When you reach level 2, you are able to use your ability to channel energy into items to your advantage when creating permanent magical items. You have advantage on all skill checks made to perform the Enchant and Splice downtime activities.

## Reverse Polarity

Also at level 2, you learn to absorb the effects of magical attacks directed at you, attempting to heal your wounds with their power rather than just dodge their impact.

As a reaction whenever a special attack misses you, you may spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus to gain life equal to eight times your proficiency bonus. If you do so, you suffer no other harmful effects from the attack, even if you otherwise would.

## Injection Attack

At level 3, you learn to suddenly appear in the fray of battle on the back of your attacks. Whenever you strike a creature with an attack (including any of your spells) you may choose to teleport into an empty tile of your choice that is adjacent to that creature. If you do, you may not spend movement until the start of your next turn.

## Circuit Breaker

At level 3, you have learned to halt your magical energy in its tracks when your attacks go off course. Spells that are channeled into your arms are no longer lost when your empowered basic attack misses.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Buffer Overflow

Once you reach level 5, you learn to chain energy through your enemies as the magic leaps between them. Once per round when you use your Conduit Casting class feature and hit with an imbued basic attack or spell that was cast directly, you may choose to spend 1 additional essence to cause the magic to chain into another nearby target.

Each new target must be within 2 tiles of the previous one, and the chain can contain up to two targets total. Creatures can only be part of each chain once; you cannot return to them. You must hit targets beyond the first that the magic jumps to with the special attack specified in the spell description, even if you use this feature as part of an imbued basic attack.

The total number of creatures hit in this chain increases to 3 at level 9, 4 at level 13 and 5 at level 17. You must pay one essence for each jump made.

## Parallelism

Also at level 5, you learn to imbue your weapon with a spell as part of your Strike major action. This costs 1 essence, just as if you had imbued your weapon as a separate minor action.

## Static Analysis

When you reach level 6, you are able to analyze magical designs without needing to risk testing them yourself. Whenever you use the Scan minor action on a magic item or monster power, you immediately know what affixes the item has or the full text of the power.

## Mastery: Armor

At level 7, you master a technique of magical armorsmithing. You gain the ability to permanently imbue any set of armor you wield with a form of enchantment that you have mastered. When you gain this feature, select a non-prismatic armor affix with a gear point cost of 1. You automatically gain the benefit of this affix.

## Inner Loop

At level 9, you can cause your Buffer Overflow feature to chain to the same target multiple times (including immediately after affecting that target). Roll each attack separately.

## Surge Protection

At level 10, you are able to handle unusual amounts of magical energy safely. You may use the Activate minor action once more per rest before needing to make a Focus (Arcana) skill check to avoid essence overload. You have advantage on all skill checks made to create consumables during the Devise downtime activity.

## Exception Handling

When you reach level 11, you learn to recover gracefully from unexpected failure. Whenever you use your Block reaction on a critical hit, treat it as a normal hit instead.

## Arcing

At level 13, your magic flows more readily between your targets. Your spells may now chain between creatures that are up to 4 tiles away from the last creature in the chain, rather than being limited to 2 tiles when you use the Buffer Overflow class feature.
Mastery: Trinket
Once you reach level 14, you learn to master a particular form of magical trinket, using it effortlessly. Choose a trinket with a gear point total of 1. You are attuned to it and gain its benefits without it counting against the gear point total of your trinkets.

You may change your choice of trinket for this feature whenever you complete a rest.

## GOTO

At level 15, you are a master of strange nonlinear paths. You are no longer prevented from spending movement after teleporting using your Injection Attack feature.

## Multithreading

At level 17, you learn to branch your magic, executing multiple targets in parallel. When you use your Buffer Overflow feature, you may choose to branch the chain at any point, affecting multiple creatures from the same source (including from yourself).

## Stack Overflow

When you reach level 18, you have access to an incredible but diffuse repository of information, drawing upon the wisdom of those who have come before you. You are always treated as if you have a source of knowledge for the Enchant downtime activity. When you use the Splice downtime activity, you may instead choose to duplicate the original affix, leaving it intact on the original item.

## Overclock

At level 20, the Conduit is capable of using a third, incredibly powerful prismatic enchantment without being melted by the intense magic. You may equip a total of three prismatic affixes at one time, rather than the standard limit of two. Like always, you cannot equip more than one prismatic affix from a single type of gear at once.
