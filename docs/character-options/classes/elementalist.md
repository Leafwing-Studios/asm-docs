# Elementalist

**Source of Power:** Through careful study, Elementalists learn to balance the fundamental forces against each other in careful opposition, invoking elemental power to terrible effect.

**Core Mechanic:** As they mirror their spells, Elementalists must balance their elemental exposure carefully. As it rises, their power grows and they can no longer shield themselves from the intense elements. Left to grow unchecked, the elements detonate, unleashing massive power to everyone nearby.

**Specialization:** Each elementalist specializes in pairs of elements: at first, a single pair, and then a second, determining the flavor of the spells that they can cast.

**Approach to Adventure:** Elementalists gain access to powerful and unique element-focused utility spells and are unmatched in their knowledge of the elements they work with.

**Build Fundamentals:** Elementalists are easily built as strikers, but with the right choices they can serve as controllers or guardians instead:

- Striker: Double-down on critical strikes to get off detonation after detonation and blast everything to smithereens. Dash and Guard will be your most useful minor actions.
- Controller: Focus on your ailments and forced movement, taking combat talents like _merciless_ or _blowhard_ and keep your exposure in the danger zone by alternating elements. The _telekinesis_ affix lets you use the Shove minor action at long range, giving you more control from a safe distance, while the _patient_ combat talent lets you get off more attacks of opportunity with your weapons to recover essence.
- Guardian: The barrier cycle of spells lets you give absorption to your allies; amplify its effectiveness with combat talents like _encouraging_ or _supportive_. You’ll often find yourself using the Treat minor action, consider investing in affixes like _combat medic_ to make it more effective.

## Spellcasting

The elementalist is a master of magic, shaping the raw elements into tangible form to blast their foes to smithereens. Elementalist **spells** always take a major action and cost 1 essence.

As you cast spells, you build up **exposure** to the element you are working with. You can limit this exposure by casting spells of the opposing element. As you get stronger, you learn more strategies for controlling your exposure.

Your exposure ranges from 7 in one element, to 7 in the opposed element, balancing at 0 exposure to either element in the middle. It changes in the following ways:
Whenever you cast a spell, your exposure shifts towards that element by 1.
If it is a critical hit, the exposure changes by 2 instead.
Effects which can hit multiple creatures only change your exposure once for each time they are cast.

You cannot cast spells that would increase your exposure above 7 in any element. Once you gain access to the Detonation feature at level 3, you Detonate at 7 stacks instead.

Whenever your exposure to an element is 4 or more, your spells of that element (other than _twisting_ spells) are more powerful but gain a drawback. However, the critical hit threshold for spells of the opposite element is reduced by 4. _Meld_ spells gain both of these benefits, as they count as both elements. Your stacks of exposure reset 10 minutes after you last cast a spell.

<div class="infobox">

**Tracking Exposure**

If you’re playing an elementalist during a physical game of _Fonts of Power_, we recommend tracking your exposure with a physical object, as it is both important and changes rapidly. Some suggestions:

- a 15 x 15 table or two 15 x 1 charts, combined with a token to mark your current exposure
- sets of differently colored beads
- two (later four) d8s that you manipulate independently
- a small abacus

</div>

You may select 3 spells of your choice at level 1, and learn more spells at levels 4, 7, 8, 12, 16 and 19. The spells for Elementalist are listed at the end of the class description. You may only select spells that are associated with elements in your pairing(s), and you must always know at least one spell from each of the elements in your pairings.

## Duality

Elementalists manipulate the elements in pairs, using the natural opposition of the elements to manage their Exposure to the overwhelming magical energy.

Each of the 12 elements has a natural opposite, creating the following six pairings:

- Sandstorm (air and earth)
- Frostfire (fire and water)
- Thoughtscour (arcane and eldritch)
- Darklight (radiant and umbral)
- Lifeforce (primal and decay)
- Surgebreaker (electric and corrosive)

You select a pairing at level 1, and then select a second pairing at level 7. You must always know at least one spell from each of the elements in your pairings.

In addition, whenever you select a new pairing, you learn a _meld_ spell that combines the power of both elements in your pairing. _Meld_ spells do not count against the number of spells that you know.

Whenever you cast a _meld_ spell (after you learn whether it is a critical hit or not), your exposure moves towards the center. If you are at 0 exposure, you may choose which direction your exposure changes by instead. Multiple copies of a _meld_ spell created using your Spell Mirror always move your exposure in the same direction as the initial cast.

## Unbridled Energy

At level 1, elemental energy begins to leak out of you as you struggle to control its energy. At the end of each of your turns while your exposure to an element is 4, 5 or 6, cast a spell of your choice that belongs to that element. This does not cost essence or an action. When you gain access to your second pairing, if your exposure to two seperate elements is 4, 5 or 6, you may choose to cast a spell that belongs to either element.

## Element Twisting

When you reach level 2, you learn to manipulate the elements around you in ways that help you solve problems outside of combat. The _twisting_ spells associated with each pairing are listed in the Pairings section below. Twisting spells do not count against the number of spells that you know.

When you reach level 7 and gain access to your second pairing, you also learn the _twisting_ spells associated with those elements. Every _twisting_ spell increases in power at level 10 and 18.

## Equilibrium

Also at level 2, you can call on the power of the elements to close your wounds, literally patching your body with elemental substances as you hold the forces within yourself in perfect opposition. At the end of each of your turns while your exposure is exactly 0 to all elements, gain the benefit of the Defend major action and spend essence equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Regain life equal to eight times your proficiency bonus.

## Detonation

At level 3, your elemental energy builds up, exploding in a powerful burst when it overwhelms you.

At the end of each of your turns, if your exposure to an element is 7 or more, you Detonate. All creatures within 2 tiles of you suffer a harmful effect based on your exposure’s type, listed in the Pairings section below. Then, reduce your exposure associated with that element to 0. This counts as a multi-target power for the purpose of effects such as the _imbued thaumaturgy_ affix.

When you gain your second pairing of elements at level 7, each pair of elements detonates independently (possibly on the same turn), with no effect on the other stack of exposure. When this happens, you may choose which order the Detonation resolves in.

## Power Siphon

Also at level 3, you gain the ability to leech magical power from those you attack. Whenever you hit an enemy with a basic attack, restore 1 essence. If it was a critical hit, restore 2 essence instead.

## Attribute Improvement

When you reach level 4, 8, 12, 16 and 19 you become tangibly more talented, and can increase one Attribute of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase your score above +5 in this way.

## Proficiency Bonus Improvement

At levels 5, 9, 13 and 17 your proficiency bonus increases by 1, as shown in the table below.

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1-4   | +1                |
| 5-8   | +2                |
| 9-12  | +3                |
| 13-16 | +4                |
| 17-20 | +5                |

See the Leveling Up section in the Narrative Mechanics chapter for a reminder of the factors that change when this occurs.

## Spell Mirror

When you reach level 5, you learn the ability to mirror the spells you cast. Whenever you cast a spell, you may copy it some number of times based on your level. For each copy you cast, you must spend one essence and may choose a new target. These copies resolve in the order of your choice and casting multiple copies affects your exposure multiple times, as you would expect. Whenever you cast a spell, you can create a total number of copies of it equal to your proficiency bonus, at the cost of 1 essence per copy.

## Elemental Intuition

At level 6, your intuition allows you to innately sense the elements around you. You automatically detect any source or usage of your chosen elements within 12 tiles of you, and understand approximately what it is being used for. Additionally, you have advantage on any Arcana checks to understand or modify magic that uses your chosen elements.

## Spell Prism

When you reach level 11, you are able to refract different elements and spells when mirroring them, using your skill to find common factors between each spell. When you use your Spell Mirror feature, you can pick different spells, as long as one of the following ailments is true:

- All of the spells you selected share the same element (meld spells count as both elements)
- All of the spells you selected are part of the same cycle (for example, all the _meld_ or _spray_ spells form a cycle)

## Elemental Crafting

At level 14, your knowledge of the push and pull of elemental forces allows you to balance them in the physical objects around you. You have advantage on all skill checks made to Enchant, Disenchant or Splice affixes as a downtime activity as long as the affix has at least one of the elements in your pairings as a tag.

## Shaped Charge

At level 15, you are able to carefully focus your outbursts of magical energy. When you use your Detonation feature, select one of the following shapes for the effect:

- a 2 tile radius sphere centered on yourself
- a 4 tile cone centered on yourself, in a direction of your choosing
- a 8 tile by 1 tile line, starting at yourself, in a direction of your choosing

## Fusion

When you reach level 20, you learn to combine your spells in a spectacular fashion, blending them together fluidly. When you use your Spell Mirror class feature, you gain one of the following benefits, depending on the relation between the spells copied:

- If the spells are identical: After you land a critical hit with a copy of the spell, all subsequent spells are automatically a critical if they hit.
- If the spells share an element but are not identical: After you finish casting these spells, set your exposure in that element to any value between 0 and 7.
- If the spells are part of the same cycle but are not identical: Your spells deal hybrid damage of all the elemental damage types that would be dealt.
