# Equipping Gear

Unsurprisingly, you only gain the benefit of gear that you have equipped. The details of how this works varies based on the type of gear:

- You may have up to one set of arms equipped at any time.
  - You can change which set of arms you have equipped by taking the Swap minor action.
  - While you have no arms equipped, your basic attacks deal 1d4 physical damage on hit at melee range.
- You may have up to one set of set of armor equipped at any time.
  - You cannot change the set of armor you have equipped while in combat.
  - While you are not wearing armor, your basic defense is calculated as 10 + Prowess + Agility.
- The collection of trinkets that you are attuned to is always equipped.

To deterimine which pieces of gear you can effectively equip, you need to look at their affixes.
Each of these affixes has a cost, in terms of **gear points,** and the sum of these costs (the item’s innate or enchantment **gear point total**) determines whether or not you can equip it and gain its benefits.

**Unconventional Equipment**

The flavor details of gear in _Fonts of Power_ are deliberately very flexible: the affixes determine their function during combat, and how that looks in-universe should be left to the player (or worldspeaker) controlling the character.

If you're looking to build gear that doesn't follow the standard tropes, there are several particularly flavorful affixes to consider:

- The _adaptable_ armor affix lets you quickly swap arms back and forth, which is fantastic for builds that want to interleave natural weapon attacks.
- The _embodied enchantments_ trinket affix, which lets you rapidly move your arms enchantments around between various weapons.
- Various arms affixes with the _mode_ tag, which lets you quickly swap between different styles of basic attack.
- The _gallant_ arms affix, which is great for capturing the feeling of swapping between offense and defense as you swap a shield in or out.

In order to effectively use a set of arms or armor:

**innate gear point total ≤ Prowess / 2**

In contrast to the standard rule to round down, these values are not rounded.

If you do not meet these requirements, a piece of gear is treated as **unsuitable:**

- Unsuitable melee weapons deal 1d6 physical damage and has no other effect.
- Unsuitable ranged weapons deal 1d4 physical damage at a range of 6 tiles and has no other effect.
- Unsuitable armor offers no benefit whatsoever, and you are treated as if you were not wearing armor.

When a character attempts to use something that would not normally be used in combat as an **improvised weapon,** work together to determine a plausible set of affixes for it.
If that’s not worth the hassle, simply treat the weapon as unsuitable.

You must use the **Attune** downtime activity (see the [Downtime Activities](rules/downtime-activities.md) chapter) in order to gain the benefits of its enchantments. You can only attune to a piece of gear if:

**enchantment gear point total ≤ proficiency bonus**
