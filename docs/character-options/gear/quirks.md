# Quirks

Every piece of gear has a particular **quirk** to it: something simple and distinctive about it. As living magic flows through these items, they take on a tiny personality and story of their own, reflecting the own idiosyncracies that make the weapon you just found more than just another magic sword.

Quirks have limited practical use: while they might occasionally have utility comparable to a piece of adventuring gear, they should not affect combat. If you're looking for a strange and unique combat-relevant trait, create a custom affix instead.

Items' quirks are driven by their past: the details of their design, the fashion in which they were created, or some remarkable event that they were part of. Whenever you create a new item, grant it new powers or uncover it's hidden past (perhaps when you first attune to it), the player responsible (or the worldspeaker, if it was an item that the players found in the world) may choose a quirk for it, or alter its existing quirk.

Items typically only have one quirk at a time: expand upon or replace the existing quirk if you want to continue that item's story. To get you started, we've provided some random tables that reflect the type of crafting skill that was used to create the item.
