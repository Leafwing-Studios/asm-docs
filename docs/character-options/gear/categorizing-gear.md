# Categorizing Gear

_Fonts of Power_ splits gear into four different **types:** arms, armor, trinkets, and consumables. Every affix is categorized according to these types, which define the types of benefits offered.

<div class="infobox">

**Essence Crystals**

Essence crystals are pure, crystallized magical energy. Glowing faintly, they cast tiny twelve-color rainbows as the float gently in the palm of your hand.

These marble-sized crystals are the raw material needed to create powerful enchantments for gear. This, of course, makes them the single most valuable currency for anyone with an inclination towards adventuring (or need of their services).

You can find essence crystals as loot, earn it as a reward for completing deals, gather them from scratch using the Harvest downtime activity or convert enchantments back into essence crystals using the Disenchant downtime activity.

**Arms** are the weapons and shield that you use in your hands, and determine your ability to attack or block. Basic attacks are made using a single attack roll with the arms that you have equipped, whether they are:

- A single one-handed weapon
- Two one-handed weapons
- A single one-handed weapon and a shield
- A two handed weapon
- An enchanted book that improves your magical powers
- Your ferocious claws

Even if you never intend to make a basic attack, you can still equip and enchant arms in order to enhance or modify your magical powers.

The second type of gear is **armor,** which you wear to protect yourself. We abstract over the details: helmets, pants, chest pieces, boots, gloves and so on are all part of the same set of armor, and you typically gain the effect of your armor unless it is seriously damaged or most of the pieces are missing.

**Trinkets** are the final type of permanent equipment. These are magical items which give you access to useful and unusual powers and enable you to perform extraordinary feats. They may be an amulet, a ring, a pair of lucky boots, enchanted gloves, or a magical tattoo. Trinkets typically offer problem-solving tools: the ability to fly, a bonus during social interactions, an unusual talent for crafting or so on.

**Consumables** are single-use magical items designed to offer a temporary boost in power. They might be a potion of healing, a poison that coats your blade, a scroll with ancient magic or a devious trap. Consumables are created using the affix system and the Devise downtime activity, and used with the Activate minor action. Over-use of consumables can have serious consequences as your body is flooded with magical energy, suffering exhaustion due to essence overload.

**The Power of Consumables**

Consumable magic items in _Fonts of Power_ are intended to be both commonly used and powerful, shaping the fight, solving problems and creating exciting, dramatic moments.

Each creature gets one free use of a consumable every rest via the [Activate minor action](rules/combat/acting-in-combat/minor-actions?id=activate), encouraging players (and particularly cunning or dangerous monsters!) to use consumables regularly, rather than hoarding them to trivialize a harder challenge that might never come.

When designing your own consumable affixes, it's helpful to keep the following balance guidelines in mind:

- Consumables with an instant effect typically have a power equal to spending two times their gear point total worth of essence in a single minor action
  - See the Monster Power Builder in the _Worldspeaker's Guide to Font's of Power_ for more details and ideas.
- Consumables with a lingering effect tend to last until the end of the party's next rest.
  - These are costed similarly to equivalent arms / armor / trinket affixes.
  - Effects which are particularly effective at countering a particular strategy or whose power is highly ailmental (such as immunity to a particular elemental damage or dramatically increased range) cost about twice as much as usual, to reflect the ability to simply use a different consumable when these consumables are ineffective.

Affixes come in four different **rarities,** which reflect their in-game mechanical complexity and change how difficult they are to craft: **common, advanced, exotic,** and **prismatic.**

Prismatic affixes are rare, powerful and build-defining, comparable to the **capstone** feature that you receive upon reaching level 20. You may equip your first prismatic affix at level 9, and your second piece at level 17. You cannot equip more than one prismatic affix of a particular type of gear at once, although you may be attuned to two prismatic affixes on seperate weapons and then swap between them.

Affixes can be applied either as **innate affixes** or **enchanted affixes** (sometimes called **enchantments**). Innate affixes determine the basic properties of the gear, such as a weapon’s reach, or whether a set of armor is covered in lacerating spikes. **Innate affixes are restricted to the common rarity affixes, reflecting their simpler construction.**

Once you’ve Crafted your item, you can Enchant it. **You can use any rarity of affix as an enchantment,** allowing you to access stranger and more complex effects, such as a weapon that changes forms as you attack with it or armor that lets you blend perfectly into the shadows.
