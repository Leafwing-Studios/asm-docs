# Manifestations

## Blade

When you use the Swap minor action, you may summon a blade of swirling elements to your hand. These weapons (which can take any form you wish) are powered by your innate energy, granting you additional power but fading shortly after they leave your grasp.

When you learn this manifestation, create a set of arms using the standard rules. You are always attuned to these arms, and they do not count against your attunement limit. You may change these arms when you level up as one of the two choices you may modify, but cannot alter them using the Craft downtime activity.

These arms always have the *elemental weaponry* affix corresponding to the element associated with your domain, changing the type of damage that they deal.

When you use the Strike major action (including as an attack of opportunity), you can Surge this manifestation:
- **Odd:** These arms gain additional affixes that persist until the sooner of a) the next time you make a basic attack or b) the start of your next turn c) you unequip these arms. 
- **Even:** These arms deal additional damage on a basic attack. 

**Characteristic Manifestation:** Your arms created by the Blade manifestation have the **shifting** affix. This affix allows you to select two forms for the arms created, which you may choose between whenever you use the Swap minor action and replace freely with other common affixes when you use the Attune downtime activity.

## Blast
You hurl a blast of elements at your foe. As a major action, make an Agility attack with this Manifestation against all creatures within a radius of a tile you select within 12 tiles, dealing elemental damage and inflicting a minor additional effect on hit based on your Domain. Creatures that you miss still suffer the attack's effect at half efficacy.

When you Surge this manifestation:
- **Odd:** The radius of the blast increases.
- **Even:** The blasts deal additional damage.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Blast manifestation, you may cause its path to bend and twist before it explodes. You no longer need to have a clear line of sight to the point at which it detonates, although it must be in range and the explosion itself is still affected by cover.

## Breath
The elements sweep across the battlefield, carrying with them everything in their path.

As a minor action, select a direction and a central tile within a range of 6 tiles. Make a Shove attack against all creatures in a radius around the central tile, pushing them back 1 tile in the direction you selected if you hit. You repeat this pattern a number of times, selecting a new direction and using the tile adjacent to the central tile in the specified direction as the new central tile. 

The new direction must be the same as or adjacent to the previous direction selected. For example, if you were using a square grid and had selected north as your original direction, the next direction selected must be north-west, north or north-east.

When you Surge this manifestation:
- **Odd:** The radius of the pushing effect increases.
- **Even:** You may push an additional time.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Breath manifestation, you can choose its new direction freely.

## Expel
By destabilizing existing ailments in a creature’s body, you can transmute them into an intense burst of elemental energy, curing your target even as you blast everything around them.
As a minor action, select a creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. Gain the benefit of the Treat minor action targeting them. If you successfully remove ailments or afflictions from them, make a Prowess attack against all creatures within a radius around them, dealing elemental damage if you hit based on the number of stacks of afflictions or ailments removed. Creatures that you miss still suffer the attack's effects at half efficacy.

When you Surge this manifestation:
- **Odd:** The radius of the pushing effect increases.
- **Even:** You may push an additional time.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** When you use your Expel manifestation, you may shift your target once before they explode.

## Grasp
Elements grasp at your foe, holding them tight as they crush them with raw force. When you use the Swap minor action, you may augment your grasp with terrible elemental energy.

When you learn this manifestation, create a set of arms using the standard rules. You are always attuned to these arms, and they do not count against your attunement limit. You may change these arms when you level up as one of the two choices you may modify, but cannot alter them using the Craft downtime activity.

These arms always have the *grasping* affix, which makes you unable to make basic attacks with them but grants you an automatic Expose attack after you hit a creature with a Grapple attack.

When you use the Grapple major action (including as an attack of opportunity), you can Surge this manifestation:
- **Odd:** These arms gain additional affixes that persist until the sooner of a) the next time you make a Grapple attack or b) the start of your next turn c) you unequip these arms. 
- **Even:** These arms deal additional elemental damage at the end of each of your turns to each creature that you are grappling.

**Characteristic Manifestation:** The arms created by your Grasp manifestation have the *grasping appendages* affix, which allows you to grapple any number of creatures at once.

        - If you hit, they take elemental damage as listed in the table below.

Your Shaping manifestation creates a tile effect as described by your Domain. The tiles that you modify with each use of this manifestation must always be connected, although separate uses of it need not be.

After you use this manifestation, roll a d20 to see if the Shaping manifestation is triggered. 
If the result is at least the triggering threshold, a special effect occurs on all tiles covered by your Shaping manifestation as described by your domain.
As a party, you may spend a Resolve to modify the outcome of this triggering roll.

You may have any number of tiles affected by your Shaping manifestation.

## Storm

As a major action, you cause the elements rain fury down upon an area within a radius of the point you choose within 60 feet. Whenever a creature begins its turn within the storm or enters it for the first time in their turn, make an Agility attack against them. If you hit, deal elemental damage to them. Creatures in the storm also suffer an additional effect according to your Domain.

You may only have one Storm manifestation active at once; using this ability again ends the previous effect. It persists as long as you maintain your concentration but if you lose your concentration during this time, the effect immediately ends.
