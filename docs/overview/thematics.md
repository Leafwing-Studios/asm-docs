# Big Picture Questions about Thematics

## What is the world like?

_Assimilation_ is set on a post-apocalyptic earth, where humans have gone extinct due to an environmental catastrophe of their own making.

Eusocial insects (inspired by leafcutter ants) are the primary protagonists, so the operating scale is incredibly small: you can see individual rain drops and mounds appear like mountains.

## What are the player's goals?

The player _is_ the factory hivemind. They control a broad faction of evolved insects, plants, fungi and more as they seek to build a complex and resilient civilization. They must gather, distribute and transform resources to grow their colony and advance technologically.

## What contrasting themes does this game focus on?

- chaotic life | orderly automation
- serenity of nature | danger of nature
- untouched wilderness | remnants of pollution
- trying to do better than humans | repeating the same steps

## What narrative challenges does the player face?

- internal
  - carefully convincing units to prioritize tasks appropriately
  - controlling the spread of their own structures
  - optimizing sustainable harvests
- external
  - controlling weeds
  - fighting off raiders
  - coping with shifting weather
  - exploring dangerous new terrain
  - (?) other colonies attacking you, increasing in hostility as you diverge genetically

## What are the common experiential beats?

- positive
  - you complete genetic research
  - you domesticate a new species
  - you successfully repel an attack
  - you harvest and use a new resource
  - you complete a new outpost
- negative
  - a sudden environmental change occurs
  - your base is under attack
  - a subassembly fails
  - cascading failure starts to occur
- neutral
  - a subassembly is complete
  - you complete zoning for a new subassembly
  - you start a new course for your genetic research
  - you uncover a new area of the map

## What aesthetics have inspired this game?

- strange earth biology
- Factorio
- glowing fungi
- strange mutants
- Bug's Life, Pikmin and other small-world media
- Starcraft Zerg

## What's the emotional message we're trying to send?

- nature is weird and wonderful
- environmental sustainability and robustness are key
- we can shape the world if we choose to, and build something worthwhile
- the proper incentives and a light touch can create incredible systems

# Constraints

- no humans
- no single, living characters
- must be easily contrasted to Factorio
- tiny scale
- no brutal violence
- environmental storytelling only

# Key Uncertainties

- what art style are we looking for?
- how are units animated?
- how 2D or 3D do we want our world to be?
- why are the humans gone?
- what did they leave behind?
- how can we help players emotionally identify with the colony?
- what do we call the overarching faction / collective / colony?
- how do we handle massive distances? mini colonies with a limited map size that trade?
