# Vision

## Fog of War

- works just like in WC3

## Constraints

- vision must be finite, in order to limit the amount of map that needs to exist / be computed
- vision must be localized to your own units, in order to encourage scouting
- vision must be timely, in order to encourage repeated scouting

## Key Uncertainties

- should we have something that operates similar to radar? Is this better suited to making self-sustaining outposts?
- do we want flying units for scouting?
