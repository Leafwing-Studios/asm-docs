## Constraints

## Key Uncertainties

- what interesting environmental variation do we have?
  - tides?
  - giant trees?
  - soil features?
  - hills and pits?
  - lakes?
  - resource deposits?
  - hostile organisms?
- are there large plants and animals?
  - how would they be represented or simulated?
  - if not, why are they all gone?
- what scale, precisely, are we operating on?
