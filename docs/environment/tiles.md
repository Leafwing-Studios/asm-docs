# Tiles

## Desired Properties

## Constraints

## Key Uncertainties

- how large are tiles relative to units?
- how do we handle units that are larger than a tile?
- how do we handle unit collision?
  - probably don't
  - reduce speed and diffusivity when tiles are full of units
  - repel units from each other with signals
