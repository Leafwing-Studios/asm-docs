# Map Generation

## Desired Properties

- strong, meaningful spatial heterogeneity
- patchy resource distribution

## Constraints

- must be controllable with a random seed

## Key Uncertainties

- what are the resources in question?
- how are threats handled?
- how are we handling map size?
- do we want a burn-in period?
