Organisms and resources steadily produce signals, slowly spreading out.

# Constraints

- everything needs a different type of signal, or differences can't be detected
- everything needs to produce a signal, or it can't be detected
- updating needs to be fast: we need to use matrix mathematics to do this in efficient batches

# Key Uncertainties

- does chasing a moving target using signals work properly? Is this desired?
- are waves produced when buildings / resources only tick infrequently?
- how can we tweak and alter signals in interesting ways to change the default behaviors?
