Each need has a threshold at which they become pressing. When a need is pressing, the unit's intention is automatically set, bypassing the ordinary process.

Until a need is fulfilled, intention is not checked in the ordinary fashion, preventing deadly yo-yoing between needs.

# Tolerances

- units occasionally dying because they're stupid and wander too far from a source of food / water is probably fine

# Constraints

- needs must override wants
- units should not yo-yo between two different needs
- failing to meet a need should have consequences. Ideally these are smooth

# Key Uncertainties

- what needs exist?
- how do we want to manage defecation?
- how do we want to manage nutritional balance?
