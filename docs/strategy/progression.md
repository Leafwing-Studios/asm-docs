# Staged Progression

Complexity is gated, by stratifying options into a natural progression.

Rather than tech tree, use prominent and organized achievement system.
Very similar to a quest system, but can be completed in any order.
Displays on screen with ability to add / remove achievements of your choice.

Needs to be tied to in-game benefit to feel tangible. When you complete an achievement, improve pheromones and unlock **relics**, which modify the game experience for new runs.

Relics can be combined to produce interesting new game modes.

## Foraging

- breeding and rearing ants
  - queens produce eggs which transform into larvae which turn into adults
    - occurs when well-fed
  - differentiation is random: queens and workers
    - weighted to auto-balance based on passive signals of strains
  - larvae need food but can't work; create pull signals asking for food
- harvesting food from the environment
- pheromones
  - help direct ants
  - control egg type
  - combat
- introduction to zoning
  - moving dirt around with zoning
  - clear paths
  - zone for storage: food and dirt

## Domestication and Agriculture

- learn about domestication
  - transplant something into base
  - create special domestication zoning: suppresses passive signals (for your workers)
  - perform research on those organisms by performing work: must keep plants / mushrooms in there alive
  - domestication zone will very slowly produce organisms / seeds / eggs of the specified type
    - basically exists to combat strain extinction
- domesticate plants
  - requires seeds
- domesticate mushrooms
  - propagated by cuttings
- basic supply chain: plants -> mushrooms -> ants
  - starting mushrooms don't produce pull signal
  - introduction to signal sensitivity and production rates

## Introduction to Genetics

- introduction to genetic evolution
  - build labs
    - variant of starting mushroom, automatically unlocked by combining plastic and mushrooms
    - require workers to perform work
  - gather wild strains to get genetic material
    - diminishing returns from strains you've already studied
  - strain management
    - creating new strains, merging old ones
- basic combat
  - soldier ants
  - walls
  - combat pheromones
- convenience features
  - mushroom chests
  - directly edible, less efficient plants

## Industrial Revolution

- intermediate resources
  - compost, which must balance N, P and C
  - dirt, separated into sand, silt and clay
- derived resources
  - prepared buff foods
  - buff fertilizer
  - stone-reinforced mushroom walls
    - sidegrade, does not regenerate fully
- nutrient cycles
  - nitrogen fixing plants
  - mining phosphorus
- harvesting from abroad
  - stone
  - dirt
  - phosphorus

## Resource Transportation

- three high-volume transport solutions
  - beetles: carry arbitrary goods quickly, but lumpy flow, require signal guidance, must be fed etc...
  - mycorrhizae: automatically balance and distribute base resources: energy, water, nitrogen and phosphorus
  - waterways: high-throughput, low fuss, reliable, very expensive to move, prone to flooding, unidirectional
  - mycorrhizae and waterways cannot cross?
- specialized transporters
  - inserters
    - adapt mycorrhizae into above-ground pipe-like inserters
    - mushrooms that cannot exist on their own; must always be adjacent to another structure
  - chairlifts?
  - dandelions floating resources on wind?
- beetles
  - domestication
  - uses signal network for transportation
  - train jumping???
- mycorrhizae
  - domestication by digging up ground
  - must coexist with other plants
- waterways
  - by default, can only float not-dense woody plants down river
  - creates rafts for large scale
    - carry empty rafts back up
  - domesticate waxy plants to create floating bubbles / fluid transport vesicles
- underground tunnels
  - just for walking in
  - competes with mycorrhizae and rivers
  - similar levels of hand-waving as underground belts / pipes
  - only one level of underground, always just below the surface

## Advanced Warfare

- poison mushrooms
- carnivorous plants
  - sticky plant traps
  - convert enemy attacks into useful resources
- artillery
  - super long firing range, poor vision
- terrain modification
  - fancy cement walls
  - choke points
  - luring enemies using fake signals and fans
  - automatic flooding??
- ?fighting units?
  - ranged units that spit acid
  - rolling siege beetles that crush walls
  - banelings
- scouts
  - radar-like structures
  - units

## Fancy Signals

- unlock metal
  - use to create combinators
- fans
- repeaters?
  - requires
- signals to control egg differentiation automatically
- buffer chests
- combinators

## Bioplastics

## Strange Environment Tiers??

## Waterways

- water boatmen that carry rafts
- aquatic insects
- aquatic plants

## Spiders

- capturing is hard; must subdue dangerous foe
- strictly carnivorous; feasts on your own workers
  - create docile food strain that is not scared of the spiders
- spins webs
  - use for defense
  - create bridges
  - gather as a raw resource

## Key Uncertainties

- what intermediate resources exist?
- what cool things can you make that require more complex resources?
  - do more advanced plants and animals have niche diets?
  - can we use these resources to terraform?
- how do you improve existing pipelines?
- what are the core actions that we want to get faster / better / more automatic at?
  - tie progression to military; must keep developing resources
  - tie progression to terraforming; ability to handle and adapt new environments
- where do byproducts and pollution management fit in?
  - probably just after industrial revolution
