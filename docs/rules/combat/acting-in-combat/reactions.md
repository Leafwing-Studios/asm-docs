# Reactions

## Attack of Opportunity

Strike suddenly, taking advantage of an opening in your opponent’s defenses.

You may use any attack of your choice to make an attack of opportunity, so long as it does not cost essence and you meet the attack’s other requirements, such as being within range.

There are several ways to trigger this reaction. By default, you can make attacks of opportunity when:

- An enemy creature spends movement to both enter and leave your zone of control in a single turn. This occurs regardless of the order.
- Your ally hits an enemy with an Expose attack and designates you to capitalize on the opening they created.

Attacks of opportunity always occur before the triggering action is complete. For example, if an enemy attempts to run past you, you could make a Grapple attack against them, holding them in place just before they leave your zone of control.

Attacks which hit more than one creature can be used as attacks of opportunity so long as they meet the other requirements. However, you have disadvantage on any attack rolls made in this way against creatures other than the one who provoked the attack of opportunity.

## Block

Whenever you would take damage, you may spend your reaction to attempt to block. If you do, roll 1d4 + Agility. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you would take damage, reduce the damage that you would take by that amount.

This occurs after any non-damaging effects are applied, but before damage is prevented by absorption. As a result, you cannot typically block attacks which successfully apply the defenseless or lethargic ailments. If you Block several times in one round (such as by using the Patient combat talent), this effect does not stack with itself, and the highest value is used instead.

## Dodge

Whenever you would be hit a basic attack, Grapple attack or Shove attack, you may use the Dodge reaction. If you do, make an Agility (Athletics) skill check. If your skill check result is greater than or equal to the attack roll that hit you, the attack misses instead.

## Track

When a creature uses the Hide minor action (including if they are already hidden) and chooses at least one hiding spot that is within 6 tiles of you, you may attempt to track where they are attempting to hide. Like all effects with a range, this is blocked by full cover.

Make a Focus (Perception) skill check. If the result is greater than or equal to the Agility (Stealth) skill check from their Hide minor action, all of their hiding places within 6 tiles of you are immediately revealed.
