# Resources and Resting

Your ability to keep fighting in _Fonts of Power_ is represented through three vital resources: life, essence and exhaustion. You spend essence to recover life, and can take on exhaustion in order to recover essence.

## Life

Life is the vital essence of every creature in _Fonts of Power,_ representing their physical wellbeing and capacity to fight. Life is quickly recovered as creatures’ innate essence mends them back into the form they are meant to be, leaving them whole but completely exhausted.

Your life can never go below 0: instead, when your life reaches 0 you enter [death’s door](../combat/statuses.md#death39s-door), and must choose whether to slip into unconsciousness or continue fighting while risking death.

Player characters have maximum life 25 + 5 × their level. It can be restored through resting, self-healing magic (received at level 2) or consumable magic items.

Occasionally, the distinction between **losing life** and **taking damage** can matter. Damage prevented (by absorption or the Block reaction or some other means) counts as damage taken, but not life lost, and life lost cannot be prevented. You only lose life when your life total actually decreases.

## Absorption

Creatures can gain **absorption,** a short-lasting replacement for life points that represents absorptive armoring or a protective force. Damage taken is subtracted from your absorption before your life. At the start of each of your turns (before any other effects occur), reduce your absorption by the amount of absorption you had at the end of your last turn, to a minimum of 0. Ordinarily, this just causes your absorption to be reduced to 0 at the start of each of your turns. The only time this does not occur is when you gain absorption at a time when it was not your turn, such as when it was received as a boon from an ally.

Absorption gained can stack, increasing the buffer of life points that must be dealt with before you suffer actual damage.

## Essence

Essence is the magical energy of _Font of Power,_ permeating the world and pulsing through the veins of every creature, including your characters. It is innate and omnipresent, but the concentration of it varies from creature to creature and place to place. Too much essence can quickly make one sick, or cause other bizarre and unexpected results. As your character trains and practices, they become more adept with essence, able to draw deeper from their own reserves and capable of handling more powerful magical items without becoming overwhelmed.

Essence is spent to power your class features, allowing you to cast spells or perform remarkable feats.

Each player character has proficiency bonus × (6 + Focus) essence, which can be restored by resting or using the Essence Tap minor action.

Magic is your very life force: your concern should not be running out of essence, but whether overusing your powers will leave you drained beyond saving or accidentally kill you.

You can recover essence by using the Essence Tap minor action, replenishing your essence at the risk of exhaustion. When you attempt to spend more essence than you currently have, you automatically and immediately gain the benefits of the Essence Tap minor action, but only restore essence equal to twice your profiency bonus.

## Exhaustion

As your character exerts themselves, and pushes past their natural limits, they can become **exhausted.** Exhaustion stacks indefinitely, but you must eventually start making Prowess (Endurance) skill checks or die. You receive a penalty to all attack rolls and skill checks equal to the number of stacks of exhaustion you have accumulated.

You can suffer exhaustion by trying to stay conscious while on death's door, using the Essence Tap or Activate minor action, suffering a serious and persistent injury or by failing to take care of your body. Every day that you go without sleeping or drinking inflicts a stack of exhaustion. Every two days that you go without eating inflicts a stack of exhaustion as well.

Whenever you gain a stack of exhaustion that increases your exhaustion to a level greater than or equal to 7 + your Prowess, you must make a difficulty 10 Prowess (Endurance) skill check or die.

Remember that exhaustion penalizes your skill checks when doing so. You may not choose to gain a setback or opportunity when you fail this skill check, even if you are proficient in Endurance.

The only way to recover from exhaustion is by resting, or by using the Recover or Tend downtime activities.

## Resting

Characters can recover their resources and shake off exhaustion by resting. In order to rest, the party must be able to eat, sleep and relax (at least in a relative sense). They should be somewhere relatively safe and deliberately attempt to take a break to make camp. When you rest:

- Recover all your essence
- Heal for half of your total life
- Remove one stack of exhaustion
- Perform a single **downtime activity**

The party can also spend one Resolve in order to immediately gain the benefits of a rest, other than the downtime activity, at any point while outside of combat.
