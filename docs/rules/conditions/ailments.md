# Ailments

## Aloft

While aloft:

- You do not take falling damage.
- Melee attacks that you make have disadvantage.
- The efficacy of forced movement applied to you is doubled.
- You can pass through enemy tiles, and enemies can pass through your tiles.
- You ignore ground effects.
- You cannot spend movement to move laterally.
- At the end of each of your turns, you may shift once.

## Banished

You are sent to a strange, alternate plane of existence. While banished, you can only interact with other banished creatures. Creatures who are not banished can occupy and move through the same tile as you and vice versa.

Other creatures may use the Treat minor action (or other effects which remove ailments) to remove the banished ailment, even if they are not themselves banished.

When this ailment ends, reappear in the nearest empty tile. You can still perceive things normally in both worlds while banished, and you can still be seen by creatures in the normal world.

## Blinded

All other creatures are invisible to you, causing you to have disadvantage on single-target attacks.

You cannot use the Track reaction or the Scan minor action.

## Blunted

You have disadvantage on all attacks.

## Chilled

You lose your minor action each turn, but like normal may spend your major action to take a minor action if you choose. Double all lateral movement costs.

## Crazed

Whenever you would make an attack, the target is chosen randomly from those within range of that attack, excluding yourself. You must spend your major action to make an attack, before spending any movement or taking your minor action. You are treated as an enemy for all other creatures and vice versa. You must take attacks of opportunity when presented with the option to do so.

When making a multi-target attack, select a creature at random normally. You must include that creature as one of the targets.

## Cursed

You have disadvantage on all special attacks and all special attacks against you have advantage.

## Defenseless

Damage dealt to you cannot be prevented by absorption or the Block reaction.

## Frightened

You have disadvantage on all special attacks. You cannot willingly move closer to the source of your fear if you know where it is. If a different source applies frightened to you, the object of your fear changes to the most recent source.

## Lethargic

You cannot take reactions.

## Pacified

You cannot make attacks (i.e. take any actions that involve making an immediate attack roll).

Whenever you lose life, remove all stacks of pacified.

## Rooted

You cannot spend movement.

## Taunted

Attacks that you make must target the creature that applied this ailment to you. You must take attacks of opportunities against that creature if able. If a different source applies taunted to you, the object of your ire changes to the most recent source.

## Withered

You have disadvantage on basic attack rolls. Double all lateral movement costs.
