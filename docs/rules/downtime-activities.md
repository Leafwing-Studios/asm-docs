# Downtime Activities

As the party rests, characters can choose a downtime activity that they would like to spend their time doing. Downtime represents a break in the standard action, giving characters the opportunity to spend time with each other, prepare for upcoming dangers, catch up on gear upgrades, or just spend some extra time relaxing. Downtime activities provide excellent opportunities to develop or reveal character and the world.

**Extended periods of rest**

If the party is resting for an extended period in a safe location, such as while they are in town, they may continue selecting downtime activities for each rest before they return to adventuring. If the number of rests is unclear, we recommend taking two downtime activities for the extended period of rest. For extended rests of this nature, we recommend performing small scenes, either based on the downtime activities themselves, or separate scenes in-between rests. These scenes help to break up the monotony of numerous downtimes, and keep the world from feeling stagnant.

However, if the party is taking an extended rest in a dangerous area, such as an aggressive font of power, it is best to run a [gradual success Attrition Scene](rules/scenes/attrition-scenes), with each rest risking consequences from the nearby threat.

</div>

There are several well-defined downtime activities within the rules for players to select from, granting fairly general and tangible mechanical benefit. While the downtime activities that follow are the most common and generically useful options, they are not intended as an exhaustive list. Other downtime activities should offer similarly tangible benefits, in order to ensure that the choice stays meaningful.

**Enchanting skill checks** made during Downtime Activities use Expertise with either Anima, Arcana, Fontcraft or Tinkering. For the Enchant and Splice downtime activities, the difficulty of this skill check is set by the rarity of the affix that you are modifying:

- Common: difficulty 10
- Advanced: difficulty 15
- Exotic: difficulty 20
- Prismatic: difficulty 25

Every item was originally created by a particular skill, and its appearance clearly reflects that origin. You have disadvantage on crafting skill checks made with a skill other than the original skill made to make the gear.

## Attune

Forge a connection with pieces of magical gear, allowing you to tap into its magic. You only gain the benefits (or drawbacks) of any enchanted affixes of gear that you have equipped while you are attuned to it. When you use this downtime activity, you may complete change the items that you are attuned to, attuning (or unattuning) to any number of items up to your personal **attument limit** of:

- two sets of arms
- one set of armor
- one collection of trinkets

If you are already at your attunement limit for a particular type of gear, you must lose attunement to an existing set (or sets) of gear of the appropriate type to attune to a new set.
When you attune to a collection of trinkets, you may attune to any number of individual trinkets, so long as the sum of their enchantment affixes is less than or equal to your proficiency bonus.

As you gain experience and learn to control your own magic, you are able to safely use more powerful magical items. You can only attune to an item if:

**enchantment gear point total ≤ proficiency bonus**

After you perform this downtime activity, you are particularly in touch with your magical items for a short period of time. One time before your next rest, you may modify the result of a roll after you see its outcome:

- If you attuned to a set of arms, you may treat an attack that you made while you had these arms equipped as if you had rolled a 15.
- If you attuned to a set of armor, you may treat an attack that you made against you while you had this armor equipped as if the attacker had rolled a 5.
- If you attuned to a collection of trinkets, you may treat a related skill check as if you had rolled a 15. This is deliberately broad: if it is narratively plausible that the trinket could have helped you accomplish the task for which you rolled the skill check, you may use this benefit.

## Bond

Grow closer to another party member, improving your cooperation. Both party members must select this downtime activity in order to gain its benefits. Until you next complete a rest:

- you have advantage on any skill check made to attempt to help each other them on skill checks
- you have advantage on any skill checks or attack rolls made to use the Treat, Break Grapple or Expose actions to benefit each other

## Challenge

Challenge an NPC to a contest of some sort, wagering that your skill is superior, and winning or losing the stakes of your bet based on the outcome. Mechanically:

1. Propose a method of contest for both you and the NPC, selecting both a skill and an attribute.
1. Propose a set of stakes for both you and the NPC.
1. Borrowing rules from the Deals and Ideals section found in the Scenes chapter, the NPC evaluates this challenge’s payoff and plausibility, accepting the challenge if their sum is at least 0.
   - You may use both Deception and Salesmanship to influence their perception of the payoff and plausibility.
1. Make an opposed skill check against the NPC.
1. If you win, you gain your half of the stakes of your bet. If you lose, hand over the stakes of the bet or their loyalty to you decreases by 1 or 2 due to Broken Trust.
1. If you win by 5 or more their loyalty towards you increases by 1, as you Earn Their Respect due to your superior skill. If you lose by 5 or more, their loyalty towards you decreases by 1 as you lose their respect through your abject failure.

## Connect

Improve your relationship with an NPC or faction by helping them out or building social ties. If you succeed on a suitable difficulty 15 skill check, their loyalty increases by 1.

## Craft

Attempt to create a mundane item, or modify the innate affixes of a set of arms or armor.

In order to use this downtime activity, you must have access to both the appropriate tools and raw materials. You can get these by using the Prepared for Anything system and rolling the Supplies die. Tools are not consumed, but raw materials are, whether you succeed or fail.

In order to create or modify the innate affixes of a set of arms or armor, make an Expertise (Crafting) skill check result: You may add or remove an innate affix from the set of arms or armor for every 5 points of your skill check result.

Like always, innate affixes must always be of common rarity.

Creating mundane items or structures other than arms and armor requires an Expertise (Crafting) skill check, with the difficulty set by the table in the usual fashion.

## Disenchant

Scrap a magic item completely, turning it back into essence crystals.

Make an enchanting skill check. The item’s magic is permanently lost, and you recover essence crystals equal to:

**skill check result \* enchantment gear point total / 2**

As consumables do not cost essence crystals to create, they cannot be Disenchanted. Instead, recycle them in the Devise downtime activity.

## Devise

Create a small batch of consumable magic items for your party to use out of whatever you might have on hand, powered by their user’s own essence. These might be healing potions, a poison to coat your weapon with or a clever trap.

Design a consumable by combining consumable affixes. The gear point total of consumables must be less than or equal to your proficiency bonus.

Then, make an enchanting skill check. You create a number of copies of the consumable you designed equal to your skill check result divided by 5, rounded down.

You may **recycle** existing consumables in this process. Add the total gear points of any consumables sacrificed in this way to your skill check result.

## Enchant

Enchant an item by adding or modifying one of its magical affixes. Creating new enchantments requires access to incredible energy: **you must be at a font of power in order to use the Enchant downtime activity.**

Select an affix. Successfully adding this affix to your gear, consumes 10 essence crystals per gear point of that affix (to a minimum of 5) are consumed, transformed into the magic of the enchantment (but not lost if you fail). If the affix is prismatic, 30 essence crystals must be consumed instead.

Make an enchanting skill check. If you succeed, add that affix to the item’s enchantment affixes.

If you have access to a relevant **source of knowledge,** you have advantage on this skill check. Each crafting skill uses a different source of knowledge:

- _Anima:_ you have free access to a monster (or some trophy from that monster) who has the desired enchantment.
- _Arcana:_ you have free access to some sort of book, teacher or other documentation.
- _Fontcraft:_ you are at a font of power that shares an element with the enchantment in question.
- _Tinkering:_ you have free access to an existing item with that affix.

When you successfully perform this downtime activity, you may remove any affixes of your choice from the target item, allowing you to replace them in order to keep their enchantment gear point total less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, you may choose to immediately attune to the piece of gear you just enchanted, replacing your attunement to an existing piece of gear of the same type if needed.

## Harvest

Gather essence crystals from the font of power around you. For example, you might process part of a dead monster using Anima, collect strange minor magical items using Arcana, tap into the font’s power directly using Fontcraft, or salvage scraps of machinery using Tinkering.

Make a Focus skill check with the appropriate skill. Gain 1 essence crystal for every 5 points of the skill check result.

## Prepare

Read a book, hone a talent, sharpen your weapon, practice magic, gather information from the locals, scout the area or so on. Once before the end of your next rest, after you see the result of an attack roll or skill check that you have made that is directly related to the training you performed, you may instead treat that attack roll or skill check as if you’d rolled a 15 instead.

## Recover

Focus on rest and enjoy yourself.

Remove an additional stack of exhaustion or restore half your maximum life.

## Resupply

Purchase supplies, borrow them from the locals or scavenge them from the surrounding environment. Reset the party’s Supplies die to a d6 and remove all existing adventuring gear that you have. The details of how and where you resupply influence the plausibility of having various useful pieces of equipment; it’s trivial to find firewood in the middle of a dark forest but quite hard to come across a new set of lockpicks.

See the Prepared for Anything section in the Gear chapter for more details on how Supply and adventuring gear works.

## Resurrect

<div class="infobox">

**Deadlier Death**

In less optimistic campaigns, the lurking threat of death serves an important narrative role, creating fear and raising the stakes. If your table wants to play _Fonts of Power_ in such a fashion, we recommend four, progressively more brutal options:

- Increase the difficulty of the skill check made to Resurrect creatures to 20 + your transcendence. This limits its availability significantly, especially at lower levels.
- Remove the Resurrect downtime activity completely. This keeps dead characters dead. You should probably have a back-up character ready...
- Creatures cannot choose to slip safely unconscious while at death's door; their fate is left entirely to the dice. Hopefully your allies can end the fight soon.
- Do not match the tier of the monster to the level of the party, or the number of turns per round to the number of players in the party. Instead, just put in monsters that make sense for the environment at the time. You did notice the rules for _Chase Scenes_, right?

</div>

Death is not always the end of the story. Fonts of power capture souls as they depart the bodies of the fallen, swirling in the magical vortex before they are completely absorbed. If their allies are quick and skilled however, they can coax that soul back into a new (or old) form, allowing them to fight another day.

Whenever a creature dies while at a font of power, they start to become one with its magical energy, eventually becoming absorbed. Each time the party benefits from a rest (including from Resolve) or fails a resurrection check, the dead creature gains one stack of **transcendence,** which represents the gradual absorption of their soul by the font. Whenever you gain a stack of transcendence that increases your transcendence to a level greater than or equal to 7 + your Focus, you must make a Focus (Fontcraft) skill check with a difficulty of 10 + your current transcendence. If you fail, you disappear as your spirit slips away forever.

As a downtime activity, your allies can attempt to **Resurrect** you. They must succeed on three separate skill checks, with a difficulty of 15 + your Transcendence. They may make as many of these skill checks in a single downtime activity as desired, but remember that the target gains transcendence after each failure. This skill check always uses Focus, but the skill used and which species you reincarnate as varies based on the vessel used, as shown in the table below. If multiple party members are performing this downtime activity, use the rules for [group skill checks](rules/skills/making-skill-checks?id=group-skill-checks) instead.

If more than one character uses the Resurrect downtime activity and both have proficiency in the required skill, use the highest skill modifier with advantage as per the standard rules for group skill checks.

**Resurrection Options**

| Species                      | Vessel                                               | Skill required |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Original                     | Original body                                        | Medicine       |
| Undead (Eternal or Skeleton) | Another body                                         | Medicine       |
| Fontborn                     | Badly damaged body                                   | Fontcraft      |
| Awakened                     | An ordinary animal that was special to the deceased  | Anima          |
| Undead (Spectre) or Slime    | None                                                 | Fontcraft      |
| Automata                     | An inanimate object that was special to the deceased | Tinkering      |
| Sylvan                       | A plant that was special to the deceased             | Anima          |
| Crystalline                  | 10 essence crystals                                  | Arcana         |
| Fae                          | Something from a wild place                          | Anima          |

When you return from the dead, you immediately suffer exhaustion equal to your previous transcendence. Like usual, gaining this exhaustion can kill you. Any skill checks made to resurrect you after you have died due to the exhaustion of being brought back from the dead are made with disadvantage.

## Splice

Transfer an affix from one piece of gear to another, quickly and easily giving it a new property.

Make an enchanting skill check. If you succeed, the affix is removed from the original item and added to the new item, If you fail, you must try again later but the original affix is not lost.

When you successfully perform this downtime activity, you may remove any affixes of your choice from the target item, allowing you to replace them in order to keep their enchantment gear point total less than or equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, you may choose to immediately attune to the piece of gear you just spliced the enchantment onto, replacing your attunement to an existing piece of gear of the same type if needed.

## Support

Help your allies with their downtime tasks. Make a Focus (Guidance) skill check, enabling some of your allies to either perform two downtime activities, rather than just one. The number of characters you can support in this way is equal to your skill check result divided by 10, rounded down. Characters cannot benefit from this effect more than once per downtime, and cannot select either the Recover or Support downtime activities during a period of downtime where they benefit from this effect.

## Tend

Attempt to tend to illnesses and fatigue. Make a Focus (Medicine) skill check, attempting to speed the healing of some of your allies. The number of characters you help in this way is equal to your skill check result divided by 10, rounded down. Creatures that you help, gain the benefit of the Recover downtime activity.
